# the residual versus fitted model exhits a downward linear trend discrediting
# the model assumption of y = beta_0+X1beta1+e. As e value falls there
# is a constant increase or gradual increase in the fitted values. As per
# the statement the model gets transformed as follow - y = beta_0+X1beta1-e
# But the points lie closer to the regression line so we can say that 
# there are normally distributed

# we can also observer that there is a presence of a very strong outlier
# heavily influencing the dependent variable - clathrate formation. The 10th 
# observation is extremely influential.

# Multicollinearity is not a big problem in clathrate formation dataset.
