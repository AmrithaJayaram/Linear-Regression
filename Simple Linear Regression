# the independent variable - Weight
# the dependent variable - Systolic blood pressure

# Question 1: Obtain the scatter plot and Interpret it

plot(data$weight,data$BP,main = "Weight and Blood Pressure",xlab = "weight"
     ,ylab="Blood Pressure",col=rainbow(9))

# Interpretation
# Scatter plot is a plot that is used to ascertain the type and 
# degree of linear association between the dependent and independent
# variable.
# An upwards line implies positive correlation between the two variable
# and a downward line implies a negative correlation between the two
# varaibles and lastly when no particular linear pattern can be 
# determined there exists no or neglible linear association between
# the variable.

# From the scatter plot obtained for BP and weight, we can conclude 
# the plot is almost upward sloping hence indicating a positive 
# correlation. This conjecture can be verified by performing karl 
# pearson correlation test.
cor(data[,-1])
# The correlation level between weight and blood pressure is strong.
# Hence our conjecture about the linear relationship between weight
# and blood pressure is true.

# Question 2: Find a regression line connecting the variables 
# systolic pressure and weight. Interpret the plot, intercept term 
# and regression coefficients.What do you infer from the sign of 
# regression coefficient?

# Interpretation of model
# It is a simple linear regression model explaining the linear 
# relationship between systolic blood pressure and weight. The 
# dependent variable is defined to be systolic blood pressure and
# the independent variable is defined to be weight. Weight influence
# the blood pressure of an individual. More heavier the body mass, 
# higher the blood pressure.

# In a linear regression model, the principle component is - intercept,
# slope and error. This can be expressed as 
#                          Y = a + bX + e
# so rewriting in term of weight and blood pressure we obtain
#                 Sytolic BP = a + b*Weight + e

# From the summary of the simple linear regression model we can conclude
# that Y = 69.10437 + 0.41942*X + 8.681.
# The intercept term is defined as the average or mean blood pressure
# when the weight is almost zero or neglible. The intercept value is
# positive indicating a medium or almost normal blood pressure. 

# The slope term defined as 1 unit change result in x unit change in
# the dependent variable. The slope is given to be 0.41942. A one
# percent increase in the weight of the individual results in 
# 0.41942 increase in the systolic blood pressure. The slope is a 
# positive quantity impling that both the variable move in the same 
# direction i.e. As the weight increases then the blood pressure
# increases in positive direction.

# Hypothesis Testing for the Regression coefficients - a and b

# H0: a = 0
# H1: a not equal to 0

# The acceptance and rejection of the hypothesis depends on the p 
# value. If the p value is less than 0.05 (5% significance), we accept
# the alternative hypothesis or else accept the null hypothesis.From
# the summary table we can conclude that both, intercept is significant
# or otherwise we can say that a is linearly dependent.

# H0: b = 0
# H1: b not equal to 0

# The acceptance and rejection of the hypothesis depends on the p 
# value. If the p value is less than 0.05 (5% significance), we accept
# the alternative hypothesis or else accept the null hypothesis.From
# the summary table we can conclude that, slope is significant
# or otherwise we can say that b is linearly dependent.

# The residual or standard error explains the deviation of the fitted
# values from the observed values. The residual value is estimated
# to be 8.681. From a dataset with only 26 as its population size, this
# residual value is big indicating the presence of potential outliers
# that may highly influence the observed values.

# R^2 or the coefficient of determination tells us how well the 
# independent variable explains the dependent variable. The R^2
# value is estimated to be 0.5815. It means about 58% variations in
# systolic blood pressure is explained by weight.

# The overall significance of the parameters cab be verified from
# the anova table. ANOVA or analysis of varaiance, divides the total
# variance into 2 - regression sum of squares and residual sum of 
# squares.

# H0: a and b = 0
# H1: a and b not equal 0

# From the anova table, we can conclude that the independent variable
# weight is significant since the p value is less than 0. hence we
# accept H1 and conclude that they are siginficant and there exists
# a linear relationship between BP and weight.

# construction of regression line
abline(slr)

# Intepretation of regression line
# From the graph we can conclude that there are only few values that
# lie closer to the regression line. Points that lie excessively far
# from the line may potentially influence the study of the variable.


# Question 3: Obtain the fitted values. Does the sum of fitted 
# values is equal to the sum of observed values

fitted_value = fitted.values(slr)
fitted_value

sum(fitted_value)
sum(data$BP)

# Interpretation 
# The sum of the observed values is equal to the sum of the fitted 
# values. This property is verified by finding the sum of the 
# observed bp value and fitted bp value. The property holds.

residual_values =  residuals(slr)
residual_values
sum(residual_values)

# Interpretation
# The sum of the error terms is 0 or almost zero. The value obtained
# for the residuals is 4.440892e-15 that is the value is tending
# to 0. Hence, we can also say that mean of the error term is 0

qqplot(fitted_value,residual_values)

# Interpretation
# Q-Q plot or quantitle-qunatitle plot also called as the normality
# curve, is used to check graphically if the residual values are 
# normally distributed. From the graph we can conclude that its tail
# probabilities is extending to the right more, so it is positive 
# skewed.
