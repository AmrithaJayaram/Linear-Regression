# the null deviance tells how much the model responds to intercept term only. The 
# residual deviance tells how much the model responds to all the independent variables
# The goodness of fit of the model is estimated by taking the difference between the 
# null deviance and residual deviance. Greater the difference better is the fitted
# model.

# the difference between the residual and null deviance of the housing ownership status
# taken with respect to income of the family.

# As per the cutoff, the number of households who replied yes is 7 and number of 
# households who have replied no is also 7. The number who actually replied yes but
# forecasted as no is 2. And the number of households who actually replied no but
# forcasted as yes is 4.

# Accuracy under the curve
AUC = (7+7)/(7+7+4+2)
AUC
# Thus there is a 70% accuracy in the model built for predicting the ownership status
# of about 25 households.

# increase. To estimate the cutoff value we can use Youden's Index or also referred 
# to as the J index.
